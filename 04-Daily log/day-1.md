## Date: 09 January 2026

## Total time spent:
Approximately 4 hours

## Git commands used today:
git init, git status, git add, git commit, git log, git branch -M main, git remote add origin, git push

## What I understood well:
I understood how Git tracks files locally, how commits work, and how GitHub is used to store repositories online.

## What confused me:
At first, i cant push my commit to my Github account, it shows some error. 

## One question I still have:
How the Github can be used to develop on same project by different developers together?
