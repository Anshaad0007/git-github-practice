Today’s Objective:

Today my objective is to understand the basics of Git and GitHub by doing hands-on practice. 
I want to learn how Git works locally on my system and how GitHub helps in storing and sharing code online. 
By using Obsidian, I aim to write my own notes clearly so that I can revise them later. 
This task will help me understand version control, repositories, and the real workflow used by developers.
